Version 17.02.0 (February 14, 2017)
  * General
    - Bumped copyright dates
  * Legion
    - Merged versioning branch with support for a higher performance
        version numbering computation
    - More efficient analysis for index space task launches
    - Updated custom projection function API
    - Added support for speculative mapping of predicated operations

  * Legion Prof
    - Added a stats view of processors grouped by node and processor type
    - Added ability to collapse/expand each processor/channel/memory in
        a timeline. To collapse/expand a row, click the name. To 
        collapse/expand the children of a row, click on the triangle 
        next to the name.
    - Grouped the processor timelines to be child elements under the stats
        views
    - Added on-demand loading of each processor/stats in a timeline.
        Elements are only loaded when you expand them, saving bandwidth

    - Command-line options for logging (-error and new -errlevel) support
        English names of logging levels (spew, debug, info, print,
        warn/warning, error, fatal, none) as well as integers

      and avoiding O(N^2) behavior in the number of nodes
