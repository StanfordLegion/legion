  * Tools
    - Legion Prof now supports search in the new profiler UI
    - Legion Prof now supports an HTTP client/server interface. Launch the
       server with `--serve` (on port 8080 by default) and attach a client to
       it with `--attach http://127.0.0.1:8080`
    - Legion Prof now supports a new achival mode via the `--archive`
       flag. Generate an offline profile and view it either via `--attach` or
       by uploading it to a server and navigating to
       `https://legion.stanford.edu/prof-viewer/?url=...`
    - Legion Prof modes (client/server/viewer) are now parallel by
       default, and perform heavy computations off the UI thread for
       better responsiveness
    - Add support for rendering indirect copies (i.e., gather/scatter)
    - Fix rendering of profiles over HTTP with old profiler UI
    - Fix profiling of copies with different numbers of hops between instances

Version 23.03.0 (March 27, 2023)
  * Build
    - Minimum supported CMake version is now 3.16. (Some optional features may
       continue to require even newer versions.)
    - Minimum supported GCC version is now 8.
    - Minimum supported CUDA version is now 10.
  * Legion
    - Added support for padded layout constraints to provide scratch space
       in instances for tasks to use (see examples/padded_instances).
    - Added support for tiled layout constraints to provide an ability to
       layout instances by breaking down dimensions (see examples/tiling).
  * Realm
    - An experimental UCX network backend has been added.
    - Updated the Kokkos interop to support Kokkos 4.0.
  * Python
    - Support loading Legion as a library from a stock Python interpreter.
  * Regent
    - Fixes to avoid leaking futures.
    - Improvements to Regent's predicate optimization.
  * Tools
    - Legion Prof now supports a native viewer UI. Enable it with the `viewer`
       feature (e.g., `cargo run --features=viewer`) and use the flag
       `--view`.
    - Legion Prof now has better support for rendering a subset of available
       nodes. Pass all log files (from all nodes) into Legion Prof and add the
       `--subnodes` flag to specify which ones to render. This ensures all
       copies in/out of those nodes will be shown correctly.

Version 22.12.0 (December 30, 2022)
  * Regent
    - Support for nested predication of `if` and `while` statements
  * Realm
    - Support priorities for Copy operations
    - Support building with multiple network backends enabled, and use
       -ll:networks (gasnetex/gasnet1/mpi/none) to pick which one to use
       during runtime
    - Separate CUDA runtime from Realm by removing all references to CUDA
       runtime and relying only on driver API, which fixes an issue when
       mixing static and dynamic cudart across an application and improves
       Realm’s compatibility across driver versions
  * Tools
    - Legion Prof support visualization of Channel of indirect copy, and
       Instances being used by different operations including Task, Copy
       and Fill

Version 22.09.0 (September 30, 2022)
  * Python
     - Support for running packages via `legion_python -m`
     - Support for Jupyter Notebook on single node execution.
  * Regent
     - Deprecated support for LLVM versions less than 11 in
       `setup_env.py`. These versions will be removed in the next
       release. LLVM 13 is recommended, except on ARM where LLVM 11 is
       currently required
     - Added support for provenance for all launcher operations
     - Debug info is no longer generated by default in order to
       optimize compile times. To re-enable it, run with
       `-fdebuginfo 1`
  * Legion
     - Most Legion APIs now support passing a provenance string.
       This provenance information is passed through to tools like
       Legion Spy and Legion Prof so users can map what they are
       seeing back to their source code. In the future, provenance
       strings will also be used by all Legion error messages as well.
  * Realm
     - Support for fills of arbitrary instances (via multi-hop paths where
        needed)
     - Fixed crashes when using external instances and network-registered
        memory at the same time
     - Removed all direct references to CUDA runtime library in CUDA module
     - Caching of minimum-cost data transfer path for repeated copies
     - Dependent partitioning support for image and preimage using structured
        (~affine) transforms in addition to existing unstructured (field-based)
        images/preimages

Version 22.06.0 (June 29, 2022)
  * Regent
     - Support for cross-products in index launches, as well as
        multi-level projection functors.
     - Support for HIP on AMD GPUs has been added. All tasks marked with
        `__demand(__cuda)` are automatically eligible. Note that the name of
        the annotation may change in the future to something more general, but
        for now no change is being made. Some CUDA flags have migrated to more
        general names. See below.
     - The flag `-fcuda 1` is deprecated. Use `-fgpu cuda` instead.
     - The flag `-fcuda-offline` is deprecated. Use `-fgpu-offline` instead.
     - The flag `-fcuda-arch` is deprecated. Use `-fgpu-arch` instead.
     - Enable HIP support with `-fgpu hip` and use the `-fgpu-offline` and
        `-fgpu-arch` flags as necessary/appropriate.
     - Support for new flag `-ffast-math 1` which enables fast-math
        optimizations on CPU and GPU. By default, CPU code has this
        disabled, and GPU code uses only the `contract` flag in LLVM
        to generate FMA instructions. For compute-intensive
        applications, additional performance can sometimes be unlocked
        by enabling the full suite of optimizations with `-ffast-math 1`,
        at the cost of numerical accuracy.
     - Performance improvements for CUDA allow recent LLVM versions
        (e.g., 13) to match or exceed the performance of LLVM
        3.8. Previously, performance regressions made LLVM 3.8 the
        most performant version for use with CUDA. The recommended
        LLVM version moving forward is 13, and `setup_env.py` has been
        updated to set this on all platforms.
     - The versions of GASNet and Terra are now pinned by default in
        `setup_env.py`. You can choose versions explicitly with
        `GASNET_VERSION` (as before, though the previous default was
        unpinned) and `--terra-branch`, respectively.
  * Realm
     - Allow use of system OpenMP runtime (instead of Realm-provided one) with
        `-DLegion_OpenMP_SYSTEM_RUNTIME=ON`.  This allows inter-operation with
        libraries that have already been linked to the system runtime, but
        limits each process to a single OMP processor.

Version 22.03.0 (March 27, 2022)
  * Build
     - Minimum supported cmake version is now 3.7.  (Some optional features
        continue to require even newer versions.)
  * Realm
     - Numerous bug fixes in the `gasnetex` network layer
     - CUDA and HIP support allow direct specification of which gpus to
        use via `-ll:gpu_ids` command-line option
     - Added support for copy paths using Cuda IPC between gpus on the same
        physical node
     - For applications using CUDA without the runtime API hijack AND only
        submitting work to the default CUDA stream, `-cuda:legacysync 1`
        improves the overhead of detecting the completion of device-side work
        launched by a task
     - Realm reduction copies may now indicate exclusive access to the
        destination instance, improving performance by allowing simple
        load/store instead of atomic operations
     - Custom reduction operations (including Legion's built-in ones) can
        provide HIP implementations, permitting in-place reductions in
        HIP device memory
  * Regent
     - Support for custom serialization of types in task parameters and results
     - New experimental timing library under std/timing

Version 21.12.0 (December 31, 2021)
  * Realm
     - Performance improvements for multi-dimensional copies, especially
        inter-process transfers
     - Support for loading CUDA driver (if present) at runtime instead of
        link time, allowing same binary to be used on systems with and without
        CUDA-capable GPUs (enabled with -DLegion_CUDA_DYNAMIC_LOAD=ON in
        cmake build)
     - A separate `Memory` is now created per process for external (system)
        memory instances.  This memory has no capacity for creating instances
        and can confuse applications or Legion mappers that assume exactly
        one Memory of kind `SYSTEM_MEM` exists.  Old behavior can be obtained
        with `-ll:ext_sysmem 0`, but this can fail for configurations that
        register system memory with the network and/or GPUs
     - The `MemoryQuery` now supports a `has_capacity` predicate to restrict
        results to just memories with sufficient total (not current!) capacity
        to allocate an instance of a specified size
  * Build
     - Cmake allows control of max nodes (-DLegion_MAX_NUM_NODES=...) and
        max processors/node (-DLegion_MAX_NUM_PROCS=...) supported by
        Legion build
     - Added dependency tracking to make-based builds

Version 21.09.0 (September 28, 2021)
  * Realm
     - Numerous bug fixes in the `gasnetex` network layer
     - Support for HIP memory type registration with GASNet (with
        GASNet version 2021.9.0+)
     - Arguments to spawned tasks may now be arbitrarily large (network-
        specific limits have been eliminated)
  * Regent
     - Improved support for dynamic checks on index launches with
         potential interference between different region arguments
     - Extensive fixes for separate compilation. This mode has now
         been verified to work with large-scale applications
     - Removed long-obsolete support for `__demand(__external)`
   * Pygion
     - Add support for layout constraints

Version 21.06.0 (June 24, 2021)
  * Build
    - Version information is now compiled into Realm and Legion.  This takes
        the form of a string (e.g. "legion-21.06.0") rather than anything
        that can be compared (i.e. no semantic versioning here).  Compile-time
        defines `REALM_VERSION` and `LEGION_VERSION` are available as well as
        run-time calls `Realm::Runtime::get_library_version` and
        `Legion::Runtime::get_library_version`.
  * Regent
    - Support for dynamic checks on projection functors, enabling a
        much larger class of loops to be supported as index launches
    - Support for local tasks (i.e., without going through the
      runtime) via `__demand(__local)`
  * Realm
    - Windows (MSVC) builds are now tested in CI and and therefore more likely
        to work
    - Realm runtime can now be shutdown and reinitialized in the same process.
        (Exception: GASNet-based network layers do not support this.)
    - Registration of host memory with CUDA driver is skipped for host
        memories larger than 1GB by default due to CUDA driver overhead.
        This threshold can be increased (or decreased) with `-cuda:hostreg`
  * Tools
    - New Rust implementation of Legion Prof is 5-15x faster than the
        original (even with PyPy). For more details, see:
        https://legion.stanford.edu/profiling/#rust-legion-prof

Version 21.03.0 (March 30, 2021)
  * Build
    - Cmake can build an embedded copy of GASNet as part of the Legion build
        with `-DLegion_EMBED_GASNet=ON`
  * Regent
    - Contains three breaking changes to the Regent calling convention:
      - Reductions are now aggregated into region requirements and
          sorted by the index of the first field in the field space
          among the set of fields for each reduction.
      - Task arguments may be passed through either `args` or
          `local_args` for index launched tasks. (Previously Regent
          only used `local_args`.)
      - Region values passed via `args` to an index-launched task may
          be *bogus*. Instead the region requirement should be used to
          obtain the original region.
    - Support for constant time index launches. These are enabled
        automatically, but can be forced on or off with `__demand` or
        `__forbid` with `__constant_time_launches`. This should
        improve scalability at extreme node counts.
    - Support for `rescape` and `remit` to generate metaprogrammed
      code more easily.
    - Experimental support for separate compilation via `-fspeparate 1`
        allows Regent programs to be compiled in parts (potentially in
        parallel). Note that separate compilation currently cannot be
        used with Bishop and requires one of either parallel or
        incremental compilation if `regentlib.start` is used (does not
        apply to `regentlib.saveobj` or `regentlib.save_tasks`).
  * Legion
    - In the control replication branch users will find a new implementaiton
      of Legion's physical analysis that uses heuristics to select which
      sub-trees should be used for performing the analysis. Disjoint and
      complete partitions are especially helpful in aiding the runtime.
    - There is a new implementation of the index space math inside of the
      runtime that now soundly and precisely detect congruences between
      index space math operations. This fixes a long-running class of bugs
      that would cause memory explosions in the physical analysis.
    - In the control replication branch users can now map future values into
      memories the same as they do with regions. This means that future
      payloads can be placed directly on devices like GPUs. Similarly, the
      runtime now accepts future data from tasks that also reside in any
      memory in the machine including device memories.
    - Both the master and control replication branches have support for
      index space attach operations.
    - Expensive transitive reductions on traces are now computed in the
      background allowing trace replays to begin replaying immediately
      with only partial optimizations.
  * Realm
    - Custom reduction operations (including Legion's built-in ones) can
        provide CUDA implementations, permitting in-place reductions in
        CUDA device memory
    - Support for CUDA managed memory (via `-ll:msize`) that is coherent for
        both host and device access.  Includes support for `__managed__`
        variables (only single-GPU if using CUDA runtime hijack mode)
    - `Event::wait` may be called outside of Realm tasks, having the same
        thread-blocking behavior as `Event::external_wait`
    - Experimental support for AMD HIP.  Note that testing coverage is
        incomplete, and breakages may occur in between releases.  For more
        details, see:
        https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues/1028

version 20.12.0 (December 28, 2020)
  * Build
    - Legion and Realm now require a compiler with (at least) c++11 support
    - Python scripts (e.g. legion_prof and legion_spy) require Python 3.5
  * Realm
    - Improved performance of inter-node instance copies when data is not
        contiguous in source and/or destination
    - Improved responsiveness of utility processors by not using them for
        background work by default
    - Experimental support for building on Windows with MSVC
    - Improved performance (and correctness) when running CUDA tasks without
        the runtime hijack enabled
    - Added `gasnetex` network layer that uses GASNet-EX's native API (instead
        of the legacy GASNet-1 API support).  Requires GASNet version 2020.11.0
	or newer.  For more details, see:
	https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues/986
  * Legion
    - The mapping interface no longer requires the runtime to return valid
      instances for empty regions (e.g. regions with no points their index space)
  * Tools
    - Legion Spy now has support for arbitrary number of dimensions
  * Examples
    - `examples/nccl` gives a simple example of using NCCL with Legion

Version 20.09.0 (September 28, 2020)
  * Legion
    - Support for mapper-controlled reuse of reduction instances.  See:
        https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues/545
    - Support for creating compact instances of sparse index spaces.  See:
        https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues/624
  * Realm
    - Switched from function-specific internal threads to generic "background
        workers" that are shared by all subsystems.  The number of workers is
        controlled by `-ll:bgwork` (default=2).  For further details, see:
        https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues/662
    - Numerous bug/performance/memory leak fixes
    - Support for OpenMP-enabled code running on a Python processor.  The
        total number of threads available to the processor is set with
        `-ll:pyomp` (default=1 - i.e. just the initial thread)
    - Support for C++ tasks on Python processors.  A C++ task does NOT take
        the Python GIL by default - the task body should call
        `PyGILState_{Ensure,Release}` as needed
    - Increased the maximum number of instances in a single memory from 64K
        to 4 million.
    - Improved performance of concurrent CUDA GPU->GPU copies with 3+ GPUs
  * Tools
    - An installed version of Legion now includes legion_spy, legion_prof
        scripts

Version 20.06.0 (June 29, 2020)
  * Regent
    - Support for `std/format` module for type-safe formatted printing
    - Support for documentation with LDoc
    - Support for `__future` operator to import a C API future
  * Legion
    - Support for inlining tasks into leaf contexts
    - Support for global registration callbacks inside of tasks
    - Added semantic tags for source file and line location
    - Support for multi-region accessors for region requirements with
        co-location constraints
    - Changes to semantics of deletion for index spaces, field spaces, and
        logical regions.  For details, see:
	https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues/812
    - Support for creating fields spaces with initial fields
  * Realm
    - Subgraphs can be used to capture a template of Realm operations
        that will be executed repeatedly.  Subgraph definitions include
        support for "interpolating" values into individual operations'
        arguments on each instantiation of the subgraph template
    - `create_weighted_subspaces` supports `size_t` weights for precise
        control over the size of each subspace
    - Added support for `omp critical` constructs and dynamic loop
        schedules in OpenMP tasks
    - Added support for `cudaStreamLegacy` and `cudaStreamPerThread` in
        CUDA tasks
    - Realm logs now include a timestamp (relative to runtime init)
        by default.  This behavior can be disabled with `-logtime 0`
    - Performance improvements for copies/fills of 3D instances spaces in
        GPU device memory
    - Added ability to compute a set of "covering rectangles" for sparse
        index spaces, allowing more compact representation in memory
    - Added `MultiAffineAccessor` for accessing compact instances
    - Added ability to delete a `ProcessorGroup`

Version 20.03.0 (March 31, 2020)
  * Regent
    - Behavior change: `__fields` and `__physical` now both require
        explicit field names, i.e., `__fields(r.{x, y})` rather than
        `__fields(r)`. This makes the behavior more unambiguous and
        helps to avoid bugs
    - Added `complete` and `incomplete` keywords that can be used to
        mark partitions as such
    - Added support for setting mapper ID and tag via
        `t:set_mapper_id()` and `t:set_mapping_tag_id()`
    - Initial support for predicated execution of `if` and `while`
        statements
    - Fixed several bugs, memory leaks and improved compile times
  * Legion
    - Introduction of Fortran bindings for Legion
    - Support for creating deferred index spaces from future values
    - Support for construction of partitions from a map of domains or
      from a future map
    - Support for reducing a future map to a single future asynchronously
  * Realm
    - Support for Kokkos parallel launch constructs in Realm (and therefore
        Legion) tasks.  Currently supported Kokkos execution spaces
	are: Serial, OpenMP, CUDA.  Application data remains in logical
	regions, but accessors can be converted to Kokkos (unmanaged) Views
	if needed.  See the `kokkos_interop` example
    - Introduction of experimental MPI-based network layer, enabled with
        `REALM_NETWORKS=mpi` (make) or `-DRealm_NETWORKS=mpi` (cmake).
	Use `REALM_NETWORKS=gasnet1` (or USE_GASNET=1, which still works)
	for the GASNet-based network layer (which works with GASNet-1 or
	GASNet-EX)
    - CUDA Runtime API interposer (a.k.a. "hijack") can now be disabled with
        `USE_CUDART_HIJACK=0` (make) or	`-DLegion_HIJACK_CUDART=OFF` (cmake).
	This can reduce effectivenes of task-parallelism for CUDA tasks, so
	use only if needed
    - More control over GPU selection via: `-cuda:skipgpus N` which leaves the
        first N GPUs available for other uses, `-cuda:skipbusy` which skips
	over busy GPUs, and `-cuda:minavailmem M` which skips GPUs with less
	than M device memory available
    - Reduction in memory usage of Realm internal data structures
  * Tools
    - There is a now a generic launcher script for running Python code
        with Legion that will execute an aribtrary Python program in the
        top-level task of a Legion program. This script mirrors the interface
        to CPython as closely as possible.
    - Legion Spy now supports verification and rendering of indirection copies
    - Legion Prof supports Instance layout constraints related to dimension
        ordering and field alignnment
    - Legion Prof contains a menu option for viewing ready state of operations

Version 19.12.0 (December 31, 2019)
  * Build
    - Both builds (Make and CMake) now generate `legion_defines.h` and
        `realm_defines.h`. By default these headers are generated in
        the source directory (Make) or build directory (CMake). This
        means that languages such as Regent and Python no longer
        require MAX_DIM to be specified explicitly
  * Regent
    - Support for CUDA 10
    - Support for field polymorphic tasks
    - Substantially improved the generality of the index launch
        optimization. Task arguments of the form p[i+k] may now be
        used, where k is a variable defined outside of the loop
    - Add flag `-foverride-demand-index-launch` which can be used to
        force loops to be index launched in cases where the compiler
        cannot prove the disjointness of read-write region
        arguments
    - Added reductions for complex64
    - The scripts `install.py` and `setup_env.py` now use CMake to
        build Terra by default, which should improve portability on
        most machines
    - The behavior of `-fcuda 1` has changed: this flag will now issue
        an error if CUDA cannot be enabled (e.g. because the build
        does not support CUDA, or because the machine has no
        GPUs). Omitting this flag will now enable CUDA if it is
        available (and will not error if it is not available).
        The behavior of `-fopenmp 1` has changed similarly.
    - The behavior of `__demand(__cuda)` has changed. This will now
        issue an error if a loop is not eligible for the CUDA
        transformation, regardless of whether CUDA is actually
        available on the current machine or not. The behavior of
        `__demand(__openmp)` has changed similarly.
    - The annotation `__allow(__cuda)` is now permitted, and permits
        (but does not require) tasks to be optimized with CUDA.
    - Experimental support for 2D kernel launch in the CUDA code generation
  * Python
    - Add support for copies
    - Copies and fills now support multiple fields
    - Tasks (including index launches) now support setting the mapper
        ID and tag
  * Legion
    - A major overhaul of the Legion physical analysis to use an
        approach based on bounding volume hierarchies. The change is
        not visible to users, but will likely impact performance. Most
        programs will get faster; programs that create many partitions
        frequently on the fly may get slower. The later case will be fixed
        in an upcoming release.
    - Added support for indirect copy operations such as gather and
        scatter onto existing copy launchers
  * Realm
    - `Event::subscribe` allows polling via `Event::has_triggered` to
        (eventually) succeed
    - Addition of `CompletionQueue` objects that allow multiple unordered
        `Event` triggers to be efficiently handled by a single consumer
    - Support for `omp_get_level`, `omp_in_parallel`, and
        `omp_set_num_threads` in tasks running on OpenMP processors
    - Support for unstructured scatter and/or gather in copies.  (Handling
        structured cases as well as fills/reductions remains a work in
	progress.)
    - Removed all calls to `Event::wait` from inside other Realm API calls.
        Applications now must make sure that index spaces and instance
	metadata are valid before use.  For details, see:
	https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues/465

Version 19.09.1 (September 13, 2019)
  * Regent
    - Fix for correctness bug in task inlining.  See:
        https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues/582

Version 19.09.0 (September 9, 2019)
  * Regent
    - __demand(__index_launch) has been added as an alternative to
        __demand(__parallel) on for loops that avoids confusion with the
        auto-parallelizer. __demand(__parallel) on for loops is deprecated and
        now issues a warning; in a future release this warning will be
        upgraded to an error. For details, see:
        https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues/520
    - Multi-field expasion is deprecated and now issues an error. The error
        can be temporarily downgraded to a warning, but it is advised that
        users migrate codes away from this syntax as it will become a hard
        error in a future release. For details, see:
        https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/issues/501
  * Legion
    - Support for a built-in collection of reduction operators including
        sum, product, max, and min over a variety of types for CPUs and GPUs

  * Build System
    - Makefile-based flow attempts to detect CUDA location and GASNet conduit
        if they are not specified
    - Makefile-based flow defaults to building CUDA fat binaries, but can still
        be overridden with the `GPU_ARCH` setting, which now accepts SM arch
	numbers (e.g. "70") as well as names (e.g. "volta")
