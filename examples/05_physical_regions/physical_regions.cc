  // instances of these regions which we can use for storing data.  One way
  // of creating a physical instance of a logical region is via an inline
  // mapping operation.  (We'll discuss the other way of creating physical
  // instances in the next example.)  Inline mappings map a physical instance
  // of logical region inside of this task's context.  This will give the
  // task an up-to-date copy of the data stored in these logical regions.
  // In this particular daxpy example, the data has yet to be initialized so
  // really this just creates un-initialized physical regions for the 
  // application to use.
  //
  // To perform an inline mapping we use an InlineLauncher object which is
  // similar to other launcher objects shown earlier.  The argument passed
  // to this launcher is a 'RegionRequirement' which is used to specify which
  // logical region we should be mapping as well as with what privileges
  // and coherence.  In this example we are mapping the input_lr logical
  // region with READ-WRITE privilege and EXCLUSIVE coherence.  We'll see
  // examples of other privileges in later examples.  If you're interested
  // in learning about relaxed coherence modes we refer you to our OOPSLA paper.
  // The last argument in the RegionRequirement is the logical region for 
  // which the enclosing task has privileges which in this case is the 
  // same input_lr logical region.  We'll discuss restrictions on privileges
  // more in the next example.
  RegionRequirement req(input_lr, READ_WRITE, EXCLUSIVE, input_lr);
  // We also need to specify which fields we plan to access in our
  // RegionRequirement.  To do this we invoke the 'add_field' method
  // on the RegionRequirement.
  req.add_field(FID_X);
  req.add_field(FID_Y);
  InlineLauncher input_launcher(req);

  // Once we have set up our launcher, we as the runtime to map a physical
  // region instance of our requested logical region with the given 
  // privileges and coherence.  This returns a PhysicalRegion object
  // which is handle to the physical instance which contains data
  // for the logical region.  In keeping with Legion's deferred execution
  // model the 'map_region' call is asynchronous.  This allows the
  // application to issue many of these operations in flight and to
  // perform other useful work while waiting for the region to be ready.
  //
  // One common criticism about Legion applications is that there exists
  // a dichotomy between logical and physical regions.  Programmers
  // are explicitly required to keep track of both kinds of regions and
  // know when and how to use them.  If you feel this way as well, we
  // encourage you to try out our Legion compiler in which this
  // dichotomy does not exist.  There are simply regions and the compiler
  // automatically manages the logical and physical nature of them
  // in a way that is analogous to how compilers manage the mapping 
  // between variables and architectural registers.  This runtime API
  // is designed to be expressive for all Legion programs and is not
  // necessarily designed for programmer productivity.
  PhysicalRegion input_region = runtime->map_region(ctx, input_launcher);
  // The application can either poll a physical region to see when it
  // contains valid data for the logical region using the 'is_valid'
  // method or it can explicitly wait using the 'wait_until_valid' 
  // method.  Just like waiting on a future, if the region is not ready
  // this task is pre-empted and other tasks may run while waiting
  // for the region to be ready.  Note that an application does not
  // need to explicitly wait for the physical region to be ready before
  // using it, but any call to get an accessor (described next) on
  // phsyical region that does not yet have valid data will implicitly
  // call 'wait_until_valid' to guarantee correct execution by ensuring
  // the application only can access the physical instance once the
  // data is valid.
  input_region.wait_until_valid();

  // To actually access data within a physical region, an application
  // must create a RegionAccessor.  RegionAccessors provide a level
  // of indirection between a physical instance and the application 
  // which is necessary for supporting general task code that is
  // independent of data layout.  RegionAccessors are templated on
  // the kind of accessor that they are and the type of element they
  // are accessing.  Here we illustrate only Generic accessors.  
  // Generic accessors are the simplest accessors to use and have
  // the ability to dynamically verify that all accesses they perform
  // are correct.  However, they are also very slow.  Therefore
  // they should NEVER be used in production code.  In general, we
  // encourage application developers to write two versions of any
  // function: one using Generic accessors that can be used to check
  // correctness, and then a faster version using higher performance
  // accessors (discussed in a later example).
  //
  // Note that each accessor must specify which field it is 
  // accessing and then check that the types match with the
  // field that is being accessed.  This provides a combination
  // of dynamic and static checking which ensures that the 
  // correct data is being accessed.

  // We initialize our regions with some random data.  To iterate
  // over all the points in each of the regions we use an iterator

  // In some cases it may be necessary to unmap regions and then 
  // remap them.  We'll give a compelling example of this in the

  // with READ-ONLY privileges to check the output result.
  // We really could have done this directly since WRITE-DISCARD
  // privileges are equivalent to READ-WRITE privileges in terms
  // of allowing reads and writes, but we'll explicitly unmap
  // and then reamp.  Unmapping is done with the unamp call.
  // After this call the physical region no longer contains valid
  // data and all accessors from the physical region are invalidated.

  // We can then remap the region.  Note if we wanted to remap
  // with the same privileges we could have used the 'remap_region'

  // call also guarantees that we would get the same physical
