Edit
====

This is a modified version of the original CGreenelet library to customize
it for the Legion runtime.

Note
====

CGreenlet doesn't use the "stack splicing" approach that other green threads
implementations use. This means that a whole stack will be allocated per
greenlet. This is a lot less memory effcient than using stack splicing.

You should consider this code mostly as a proof of concept. For a proven
real-world implementation of green threads with stack splicing see the
"stacklet" implementatin from PyPy:

  https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/default/rpython/translator/c/src/stacklet
  
The Stacklet API is a little bit more low-level. Stacklet would be an ideal
backend for CGreenlet.

Overview
========

CGreenlet is a FAST! and cross-platfrm coroutine library for C/C++. The API is
modeled after the Python "greenlet" API [1]_.
